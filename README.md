This is an auction app application built from scratch using mern. As this is just for an assignment, there are no API integrations with payment portals, and is only a skeleton.

Implemented features include:
1) Login page
2) Signup page
3) User authentication
4) Live auction page using sockets, with dummy bids
5) Browsing through all auctions
6) Change password functionality
7) Create an auction, with an end time
8) Keeping count of how many items a user gets and retains
